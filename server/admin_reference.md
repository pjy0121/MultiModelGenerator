## Project Concept
A Python program designed to embed documents (Specifications) and store them in a Vector DB for the purpose of extracting requirements from specific documents. It should support viewing the list of stored knowledge bases, adding and deleting them, and checking the status of knowledge bases (storage location, chunk count, etc.)
